# PRODIGY_ML_02

Job Description:
Aspiring data scientist passionate about customer segmentation and data-driven insights. Use K-means clustering to group customers in a store based on their purchasing history. Leverage Kaggle's Mall User datasets, select relevant features, and optimize the data to find impactful results. Use the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of groups and visualize the results with scatter plots and center plots. Being able to use data mining skills to create business ideas is exciting.

Full instructions:
1. Data loading: Loading and checking Customer Service data from Kaggle.
2. Attribute Selection: identify and select relevant properties for the group - "Annual Income" and "Payment Fees".
3. Data Standardization: Use StandardScaler to standardize data important for K-means clustering. 
4. How many best groups: Use the Elbow method to determine the best group.
5. K-means clustering: Use K-means clustering and select the best cluster. 
6. Visualization: Visualize customers in groups by breaking down plans and creating centralized hot plans. 
7. Insights: Understand the customer in depth and create a foundation for marketing plans.

Knowledge gained:
- Ability to process data prior to work, including specific selection and data structure.
- Applications of K-related integration algorithms for customer segmentation, including marketing and research data.
- Leverage data visualization techniques to effectively communicate complex clustering results.
- I gained experience in interpreting the Elbow process for good clustering decisions.
- Gain skills in using real world data, improve problem solving abilities in a sales environment.
  
Task Overview:
This repository is the Kaggle Dataset of My Mall Customers K - defined grouping algorithm for customer segmentation. The project includes data transfer, feature selection, data structure, determination of the best grouping and visualization of the results obtained from the explosion plan and district heating.

Skills showcased:
- Python programming
- Data analysis and pre-processing
- Machine learning (K - stands for clustering)
- Data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn )
- GitHub version control
